   <p>Hi <?= name ?>,</p>

   <p>Thanks for filling out our Discord verification form. In accordance with Arc@UNSW 
      (our student organisation) guidelines, we're required to verify your <strong>zID</strong> 
      if you're a UNSW student or your <strong>phone number</strong> before you can participate 
      in our server. Please <strong><a href="<?= form ?>">resubmit the verification form</a></strong> 
      with these details.</p>
   
   <p>If you don't verify, you'll still be able to read messages but you won't be able to 
      send messages or join voice channels. Verifying will also mean you can join our awesome 
      new Discord events and we'd love to see you there!</p>
   
   <p>See you online,<br><?= valediction ?></p>
